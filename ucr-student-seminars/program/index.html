                Here&rsquo;s where you put the abstract of the talk. Notice that with MathJax you can include mathematical notation in the abstract like \(f(x)=3x-7\) or like \(h^0(X_t,\omega_{X_t}^{\otimes m})\) or whatever you want. Just notice the MathJax line in the head of this HTML document that allows this. I&rsquo;m going to blab just a tiny bit more in this abstract, but all the other abstracts below, except the ones for the plenary talks, will be just <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> text that needs to be replaced by real abstracts.

                Next-generation telescopes (e.g., Roman space telescope) will probe the small-scale structures of the Universe with high accuracy. Thus, expensive high-resolution simulations are required to extract cosmological information at these non-linear scales, making Bayesian parameter inference impractical for future surveys. One solution is multi-fidelity emulation, which uses simulations of varying qualities (or resolutions) to train an accurate emulator at a much lower cost. We present the first implementation of multi-fidelity emulation in cosmology, where we use machine learning to model summary statistics of varying accuracies using a sequence of Gaussian processes. We show two applications of our emulation framework: the non-linear matter power spectrum and the Lya flux power spectrum. We demonstrate that our multi-fidelity emulation can achieve percent accuracy with only a few high-resolution simulations and outperform single-fidelity emulators. Our proposed multi-fidelity emulator shows a new way to predict non-linear scales, making the emulation development substantially more practical for future cosmological inference problems.

                Reionization is the last major phase transition in the history of the Universe. During the epoch of reionization, which is widely believed to occur between roughly 150 million and one billion years after the Big Bang (redshift 20 ≳ z ≳ 6), neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) was ionized by ultraviolet (UV) photons emitted by the first generations of stars and galaxies. The timing of reionization is therefore essential for us to understand the formation and evolution of the first galaxies. <br>
                Large-scale fluctuations in IGM Lyman-alpha opacity at z < 6 suggest that reionization may have ended later than is normally assumed. Alternatively, the opacity fluctuations may be driven by variations in the ionizing UV background that reionization has ended. To resolve this dilemma, we can use hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra to probe the IGM during the reionization epoch. In this talk, I will present the novel investigations of the IGM over 5 < z < 6 using dark gaps in the Lyman-ɑ&Lyman-β forest. I will show our latest results and discuss the implications for reionization.
