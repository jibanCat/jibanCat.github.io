                Ly-\(\alpha\) tomography surveys have begun to produce three-dimensional (3D) maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM) opacity at \(z \sim 2.5\) with Mpc resolution. These surveys provide an exciting new window to discover and characterize high-redshift overdensities, including the progenitors of today's massive groups and clusters of galaxies, known as protogroups and protoclusters. In this talk, I will introduce our novel method for delineating the boundaries of structures detected in 3D Ly-\(\alpha\) flux maps by applying classical image segmentation techniques. Moreover, I will argue how the Ly-\(\alpha\) tomography is complementary to the conventional galaxy surveys by discussing an interesting population of observed protoclusters, in Lyman-\(\alpha\) Tomographic IMACS Survey (LATIS), which contain surprisingly fewer UV-bright galaxies compared with the dark matter halos in mock-observed simulations. Finally, I will discuss other potential applications of these tomography surveys, such as the synergies with line intensity map (LIM) experiments.

                Multi-Fidelity Emulation for Cosmological Inference in the Roman Era

                Next-generation telescopes (e.g., Roman space telescope) will probe the small-scale structures of the Universe with high accuracy. Thus, expensive high-resolution simulations are required to extract cosmological information at these non-linear scales, making Bayesian parameter inference impractical for future surveys. One solution is multi-fidelity emulation, which uses simulations of varying qualities (or resolutions) to train an accurate emulator at a much lower cost. We present the first implementation of multi-fidelity emulation in cosmology, where we use machine learning to model summary statistics of varying accuracies using a sequence of Gaussian processes. We show two applications of our emulation framework: the non-linear matter power spectrum and the Lya flux power spectrum. We demonstrate that our multi-fidelity emulation can achieve percent accuracy with only a few high-resolution simulations and outperform single-fidelity emulators. Our proposed multi-fidelity emulator shows a new way to predict non-linear scales, making the emulation development substantially more practical for future cosmological inference problems.

                Reionization is the last major phase transition in the history of the Universe. During the epoch of reionization, which is widely believed to occur between roughly 150 million and one billion years after the Big Bang (redshift 20 ≳ z ≳ 6), neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) was ionized by ultraviolet (UV) photons emitted by the first generations of stars and galaxies. The timing of reionization is therefore essential for us to understand the formation and evolution of the first galaxies. <br>
                Large-scale fluctuations in IGM Lyman-alpha opacity at z < 6 suggest that reionization may have ended later than is normally assumed. Alternatively, the opacity fluctuations may be driven by variations in the ionizing UV background that reionization has ended. To resolve this dilemma, we can use hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra to probe the IGM during the reionization epoch. In this talk, I will present the novel investigations of the IGM over 5 < z < 6 using dark gaps in the Lyman-ɑ&Lyman-β forest. I will show our latest results and discuss the implications for reionization.

                Observations show that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with a mass of \(\sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}\) exist when the universe is just \(6\%\) of its current age. Recently, we have proposed a scenario where a self-interacting dark matter halo experiences gravothermal instability and its central region collapses into a seed black hole. Our results indicate that self-interacting dark matter can provide a unified explanation for diverse dark matter distributions in galaxies today and the origin of SMBHs at redshifts \(z \sim 6–7\). If time permits, I will talk about the other related topics of BHs.
