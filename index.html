                        <p>
                                I am a PhD student in the department of Physics and Astronomy in UC Riverside (2018-), working with <a href="http://sbird.github.io/">Simeon Bird</a> on <strong>various machine learning related topics in astronomy and cosmology</strong>.

                        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
                        <p>
                                I am interested in intergalactic medium and numerical cosmology.
                                I am also interested in using machine learning to model quasars emissions,
                                the lights from supermassive black holes.
                                I improved a <strong>Gaussian process (GP)</strong> based model (original author: <a href="https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/">Roman Garnett</a> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04460">Garnett(2017)</a>])
                                to find <strong>damped Lyman alpha absorbers (DLAs)</strong>
                                in the intergalactic medium with consideration of weak Lyman alpha absorptions
                                [<a href="https://github.com/rmgarnett/gp_dla_detection/tree/master/multi_dlas">code</a>]
                                [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11036">paper</a>].
                                I also use the GP model to find DLAs in SDSS DR16 [<a href="https://github.com/jibanCat/gp_dla_detection_dr16q_public">code</a>]
                                [<a href="https://github.com/jibanCat/gp_dla_detection_dr16q_public">paper</a>]
                                We also performed probabilistic inference on <strong>quasar redshifts</strong> using our Gaussian process
                                based model.
                                [<a href="https://github.com/sbird/gp_qso_redshift">code</a>][<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07343">paper</a>].
                                I am currently working on building <strong>emulators</strong> on a cosmological simulation-

                        <h2>Motivation</h2>
                        <p>
                                My research motivation comes from my enthusiasm for helping relieve people from labour-intensive works in academia.
                                During my time pursuing higher education, I have seen countless people lose their trust in research.
                                They were told devoting time to labour-intensive jobs was the most efficient way to produce research results for their labs.
                                I have a strong belief that automated tools or better models can replace all repetitive works.
                                Academia is a place for creative thinking.
                                At least in my field, I want to help astronomers automate their works through combining physical models and machine learning.
                                To systematically change things, I have to keep doing research on both astronomy data (e.g., Lyman alpha forest) and astrophysical simulations (e.g., MP-Gadget).
                        </p>
