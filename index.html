                                I am a PhD student in the department of Physics and Astronomy in UC Riverside (2018-), working with <a href="http://sbird.github.io/">Simeon Bird</a> on various machine learning related topics in astronomy and cosmology.

                                I am interested in intergalactic medium and numerical cosmology.
                                I am also interested in using machine learning to model quasars emissions,
                                the lights from supermassive black holes.
                                I modified a Gaussian process based model to find damped Lyman alpha absorbers (DLAs)
                                in the intergalactic medium with consideration of sub-DLAs and effective optical depth

                                [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11036">paper</a>].
                                We also performed probabilistic inference on quasar redshifts using our Gaussian process
                                based model

                                I am currently working on building emulators on a cosmological simulation-
