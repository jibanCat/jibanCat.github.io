                                One of my hobbies is text mining.
                                I was working with a classical Chinese literature researcher,
                                <a href="http://www.litphil.sinica.edu.tw/people/researchers/Zeb%20Raft">Zeb Raft</a>,
                                on making digital edition of classical literature,
                                including Han-Ji - a history book and Wen-Xuan - a book of poems.
                                It was quite a fun time working with humanity people.
                                I also sometimes play around with web scraped texts, see below:

                            Besides coding, I like playing cello, writing, pure literature, philosophy, manga, and travelling.
                            I had stopped playing cello after my undergrad graduation, but COVID gave me lots of time to stay with my cello so I started practising again.
                            Though I am not a good player, playing Bach suite helps me stabilize my emotions and work more efficiently from home.

                            I thought I would be a philosophy or literature undergrad, but my literature teacher persuaded me to do science.
                            I wrote essays during my spare time and received a few pure literature/philosophy awards before.
                            During my undergrad at National Taiwan University, I was a campus newsletter writer and have written a few articles regarding public issues.
                            I also re-built the departmental newsletter in Physics with my good friends,

                            English is not my native language, so I am still trying to practice how to write better in English.
                            Very recently, I also started to think about the problem of morality and the sources of normativity.
                            And how western philosophers like Kant answers this question differently from <a href="https://ctext.org/confucianism">Confucianism</a>
                            philosophers like <a href="https://ctext.org/mengzi">Mencius</a> and <a href="https://ctext.org/xunzi">Xunzi</a>.
                            I secretly care about grad student issues and higher education in general.
