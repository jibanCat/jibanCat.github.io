                        <p>
                                One of my hobbies is text mining.
                                I was working with a classical Chinese literature researcher,
                                <a href="http://www.litphil.sinica.edu.tw/people/researchers/Zeb%20Raft">Zeb Raft</a>,
                                on making digital edition of classical literature,
                                including Han-Ji - a history book and Wen-Xuan - a book of poems.
                                It was quite a fun time working with humanity people.
                                I also sometimes play around with web scraped texts, see below:

                        <p>
                            Besides coding, I like travelling and writing.
                            Travelling stimulates me to write, and writing makes me want to see the world.
                            I thought I would be a philosophy or literature undergrad when I was in high school, but my literature teacher persuaded me to do science.
                            I wrote essays during my spare time and received a few pure literature awards before.
                            English is not my native language, so I am still trying to practice how to write better in English.
                            I recently started to like cooking, which is believed to be a necessary skill living in the US ðŸ˜Š.

                            in the <a href="http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/EVENTS/2018/Sierra.htm">Sierra conference</a> for UC astronomy graduate
                            students in Aug 2019.
                            I highly recommend all UC astro-grads to attend
                            this event. Not only you can talk about science
                            with your fellows across campuses, but also enjoy the gorgeous nature of California. (Credit: <a href="https://bscot.github.io">Bryan Scott</a>)
