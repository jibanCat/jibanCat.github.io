                                One of my hobbies is text mining.
                                I was working with a classical Chinese literature researcher,
                                <a href="http://www.litphil.sinica.edu.tw/people/researchers/Zeb%20Raft">Zeb Raft</a>,
                                on making digital edition of classical literature,
                                including Han-Ji - a history book and Wen-Xuan - a book of poems.
                                It was quite a fun time working with humanity people.
                                I also sometimes play around with web scraped texts, see below:

                            Besides coding, I like travelling, writing, philosophy, manga, and playing cello.
                            Travelling stimulates me to write, and writing makes me want to see the world.
                            I thought I would be a philosophy or literature undergrad when I was in high school, but my literature teacher persuaded me to do science.
                            I wrote essays during my spare time and received a few pure literature/philosophy awards before.
                            English is not my native language, so I am still trying to practice how to write better in English.
                            I recently started to like cooking and baking ðŸ˜Š.
                            Very recent, I also started to think about the problem of morality and the sources of normativity.
                            And how western philosophers like Kant answers this question differently from <a href="https://ctext.org/confucianism">Confucianism</a>
                            philosophers like <a href="https://ctext.org/mengzi">Mencius</a> and <a href="https://ctext.org/xunzi">Xunzi</a>.
                            I secretly care about grad student issues and higher education in general.
                            I am currently reading a <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo33896239.html">book</a> about the underfunding issues of public universities in the US. 
                        </p>

                            <b>Behind the photo</b>: the photo was taken when I was
                            in the <a href="http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/EVENTS/2018/Sierra.htm">Sierra conference</a> for UC astronomy graduate
                            students in Aug 2019.
                            We cancelled the event in 2020 due to COVID, but we are currently looking forward to having our Sierra 2021 in this Fall!
                            I highly recommend all UC astro-grads to attend
                            this event. Not only you can talk about science
                            with your fellows across campuses, but also enjoy the gorgeous nature of California. (<a href="https://bscot.github.io">Bryan Scott</a> accidentally in the camera!)
